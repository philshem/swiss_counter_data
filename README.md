# An index of entry-counter status, and availability of open places

I made this list so as some swimming pools open, I'd like an easy index for checking how crowded they are, or if they are no longer allowing entries.

The dashboards for each place are publicly available (see screenshot)

But as far as I know, are not yet indexed.he following table to find status and availability of open places and limited entries

The python3 script [`parse_endpoints.py`](https://github.com/philshem/swiss_counter_data/blob/master/parse_endpoints.py):

+ generates list of valid endpoints, saved to [`endpoints.json`](https://github.com/philshem/swiss_counter_data/blob/master/endpoints.json)
